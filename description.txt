In this file is described the flow of the algorithm.

Flow of algorithm consists of two main steps:
	1) Decide which request will be executed on which day
	2) Decide which vehicle will execute which request

For 1) we have two possible solutions:
	1.1) Genetic algorithm
	1.2) DFS with memoization

For 2) we propose Genetic algorithm as solution with several greedy optimizations.

1.1) Genetic Algorithm description


1.1) DFS with memoization description


2) Description of Genetic Algorithm
	2.1) Chromosome description
	
	2.2) Crossover description
	
	2.3) Mutation description
	
	2.4) Selection description

	2.5) Chosing right parameters

3) Several optimizations which are done "on the way"
	3.1) Optimizing route distance
	
	3.2) Optimizing route capacity
